# Open Distro Elasticsearch SQL CLI

ODFE: Open Distro for Elasticsearch 

ODFE SQL CLI is a stand alone Python application and can be launched by a wake word `odfesql`. It serves as a support only for 
[Open Distro SQL plugin for Elasticsearch](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/sql/). You can run 
it on any OS we support, and connect to any valid remote endpoint without installing Elasticsearch.


## Installation
- `pip install odfesql` 
- odfe sql cli is compatible with Python 3, because Python 2 is no longer maintained since 01/01/2020 https://pythonclock.org/ 


## Configuration
- A config file is automatically created at `~/.config/escli/config` at first launch. 
See the file itself for a description of all available options.


## Features
- Multiline input
- Auto-completion with index suggestion
- Formatted output
    - Tabular format
    - Fields name with color
    - Enable horizontal display (by default) and vertical display when output is too wide
    - Pagination for long output
